# HueFun

I created this app for learning purposes and fun. I wanted a quick way to control each of my lamps individually with sliders in a uitableview.
There are a few bugs and to-do's left and it probably only works with the E27 color bulbs.

For the Hue-slider i have used Jonathan Hull's great Gradient-Slider: https://github.com/jonhull/GradientSlider
